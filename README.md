⚠️🚑 Road Accident Dashboard

📄 Project Description

A major issue that has an impact on communities all across the world is road safety. In this project, I have created a Road Accident Analytics Dashboard, a powerful tool designed to analyze and visualize road accident data for the years 2021 and 2022. This Excel-based dashboard empowers stakeholders with valuable insights to make data-driven decisions and pave the way towards safer roads. 🛣️✨

💡 Skills Showcased in this Project

🧹 Data Cleaning, Data Transformation, Data Analysis

🔍 Filtering, Sorting, and Conditional Functions

📊 Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts

🎨 Data Visualization and Dashboard Creation

🎯 Requirements and KPIs

Clients wanted to create a road accident dashboard for the years 2021 and 2022 to gain insights into the following aspects:

Primary KPI - Total Casualties and Total Accident values for the Current Year and YoY growth 📅📈

Primary KPIs - Total Casualties by Accident Severity for the Current Year and YoY growth 🚨

Secondary KPIs - Total Casualties concerning vehicle type for the Current Year 🚗

Monthly trend showing a comparison of casualties for the Current Year and the Previous Year 📊

Casualties by Road Type for the Current Year 🛣️

Current Year Casualties by Area/Location & by Day/Night 🌍🌙☀️

Total Casualties and Total Accidents by Location 📍

🧼 Data Cleaning and Transformation

This stage began with getting to know the dataset and checking for any data quality issues.

Checking NULL values, blanks, and Errors ⚠️

Removing duplicates and irrelevant columns 🗑️

Ensuring data consistency and cleanliness concerning data type, format, and values 🧽

Creating two new attributes: 'Year' and 'Month' for logical and easy interpretation of the dataset 🗓️

📊 Data Analysis

I created a "Data Analysis" sheet to summarize all the pivot table data for a new user, developer, or client, easing their work and information gathering. On this sheet, nine pivot tables were created to summarize the data and help identify trends focusing on the relationship between the number of casualties and many factors such as casualty type, vehicle type, road type, location, etc. Monthly trends were also analyzed for the years 2021 and 2022.

🔍 Below is a snippet of the Data Analysis Sheet:

🎨 Data Visualization

Finally, the dashboard was created by inserting and customizing the pivot charts corresponding to the pivot table. For a user-friendly and interactive experience, slicers and timelines were incorporated. Hyperlinks and connections were also added to necessary icons for seamless navigation. 🖱️🔗

🔑 Key Insights

📈 Total Casualties Analysis: The dashboard reveals that a staggering 417,883 casualties occurred during the two-year period.

📅 Peak Months: The number of casualties was slightly higher in 2021 than in 2022. Maximum casualties occurred in 
October and November in both years, while minimum casualties took place in January and February.

🚗 Casualties by Vehicle Type: Car accidents accounted for the highest number of casualties, contributing to 79.8% of the total, while casualties were minimal in accidents involving other vehicle types.

🩸 Casualties by Accident Severity: Slight severity formed the bulk of casualties (84.1%), whereas fatal severity accounted for only 1.7% of casualties.

🛣️ Road Type Analysis: Maximum casualties occurred on Single Carriageway roads (310.1K), while the minimum was on Slip roads (5.1K).

🌧️ Casualties Distribution by Road Surface: The highest distribution of total casualties was on dry road surfaces (67%).

🏙️ Casualties Relation by Area/Location: Urban areas accounted for the majority of casualties (61%).

☀️ Casualties Distribution by Light Condition: 73% of casualties occurred in daylight conditions.

📝 Recommendations Based on the Analysis

By comparing casualty trends between the current and previous years on a monthly basis, the dashboard identifies critical periods in October and November. Road safety measures by traffic police and other stakeholders must be active and focused during these high-risk periods.

Car drivers, who form the bulk of the casualties, should be targeted for awareness campaigns, strict monitoring, and periodic check-ups on safe driving. 🚗📢

Extra safety measures should be implemented on Single Carriageway roads, and they should be upgraded to double lanes wherever possible. 🛣️🚧

Understanding casualty distribution based on different road surface conditions can help pinpoint areas where road maintenance and surface improvements are essential. 🛤️🔧

Urban areas should be targeted for interventions to improve road safety, especially during the daytime. 🌆☀️

This Road Accident Analytics Dashboard opens the door to data-driven decision-making, enabling stakeholders to implement evidence-based interventions that enhance road safety. It serves as a valuable tool for policymakers, traffic authorities, and safety advocates alike.
